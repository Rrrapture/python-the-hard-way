# exercise 11: Asking Questions
print "How old are you?",
age = raw_input()
print "How tall are you?",
height = raw_input()
print "How much do you weigh?",
weight = raw_input()

print "So, you're %r old, %r tall and %r heavy." %(
	age, height, weight)

# Study drills:
# 1. research raw_input
# 2. What are other ways to use it? Copy, bio, etc.
# 3. Write another form and ask more questions.
# 4. what's with the escape sequence back slash?
